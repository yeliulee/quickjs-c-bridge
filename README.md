# Desktop bridges for quickjs

Generates shared binaries libraries to be consumed by flutter_js on desktop platforms.

## Windows

* Creating Ninja Structure

Run in Developer Command Prompt for VS2019 in this project rootFolder:

First, prepare to target x64:

```
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64
```

Now generate the Ninja project:

**Release**

```bash
cmake -S .\windows -B build\windows -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "Ninja"
```

or 

**Debug**

```bash
cmake -S .\windows -B build\windows -G "Ninja"
```

Now compile using the ninja project generated:

```bash
cmake --build .\build\windows
```

### How to see symbols exported from a dll

```dumpbin.exe /exports build/windows/quickjs_c_bridge.dll```

## Linux

At the project root directory, run:

```bash
cmake -S ./linux -B ./build/linux
```

now build the library executing the command bellow:

```bash
cmake --build build/linux
```

## OpenHarmony

At the project root directory, run:

```bash
cmake -S ./ohos -B ./build/ohos -DOHOS_STL=c++_shared -DOHOS_ARCH=arm64-v8a -DOHOS_PLATFORM=OHOS -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/native/build/cmake/ohos.toolchain.cmake
```

now build the library executing the command bellow:

```bash
cmake --build build/ohos
```
